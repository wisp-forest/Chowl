Meant for stashes of heavily compressable items, the {blue}Compressing Panel{} can store any NBT-less item with a
capacity equivalent to 2048 of the item's most compressed variety.


Unlike *some* of our competitors, it can store infinitely many\* layers of compression, with a button in the display for
every single one.
