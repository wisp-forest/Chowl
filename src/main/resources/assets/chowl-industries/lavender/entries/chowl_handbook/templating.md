While the default aesthetic of [Drawer Frames](^chowl-industries:drawer_frame) is appealing to some, many choose to
forgo the classic Oak Log grain in favor of a different block.


With the power of the patented ChowlTech Morphingâ„¢ technology, swapping out the texture is as easy as trying to place
a block where your frame is. Any attached [panels](^chowl-industries:panels) are also retextured.
