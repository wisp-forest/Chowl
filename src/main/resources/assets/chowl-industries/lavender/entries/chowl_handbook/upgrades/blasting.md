Whether you're trying to set up a trap for your competitors or just want to have a bit of fun, the [Blasting Upgrade](^chowl-industries:upgrades/blasting)
is your friend. A little bit (or a lot) of {blue}TNT{} is enough to make a panel explode when emptied.


Additionally, adding in {blue}Flint and Steel{} or a {blue}Fire Charge{} can add a bit of spice to the resulting explosion.
