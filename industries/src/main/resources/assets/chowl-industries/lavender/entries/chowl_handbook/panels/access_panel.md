Though we'd prefer that you only use Chowl® products in your builds, sometimes you just have to interface with other
machines.


To help with that, the [Access Panel](^chowl-industries:panels/access_panel) provides access to the entire network's storage, allowing you to
insert and extract from it using hoppers, pipes or any other Chowl® certified item transfer methods

Additionally, it can be used by players to insert items into any available storages in the network.
