While [Drawer Frames](^chowl-industries:drawer_frame) are mostly for storage, [templating](^chowl-industries:templating)
makes them useful for making hidden structures.

But if you want to build a hidden entrance, a
[Phantom Panel](^chowl-industries:panels/phantom_panel) is enough to make an entrance that only the most careful
will find.

And when you arrive, you can simply pass through the panel and enter your secret base.
